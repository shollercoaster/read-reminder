# Read Reminder

This app was created to get timely reminders to get back to my reading when I'm using my laptop or just surfing the internet. On a popup I can choose to setup a reading reminder, and update my progress on my current reading list. I can also directly edit my 2026 Reading List. 

Categories recorded include: research paper, book, article, blog.
